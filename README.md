### vx

vx is a collection of reusable low-level visualization components. vx combines the power of d3 to
generate your visualization with the benefits of react for updating the DOM.

## Usage

[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/kind-modem)

Let's make a simple bar graph.

First we'll install the relevant packages:

```
$ npm install --save @vx/mock-data @vx/group @vx/shape @vx/scale
```

<img src="./assets/simplebar.png" height="150" />

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { letterFrequency } from '@vx/mock-data';
import { Group } from '@vx/group';
import { Bar } from '@vx/shape';
import { scaleLinear, scaleBand } from '@vx/scale';

// We'll use some mock data from `@vx/mock-data` for this.
const data = letterFrequency;

// Define the graph dimensions and margins
const width = 500;
const height = 500;
const margin = { top: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20, right: 20 };

// Then we'll create some bounds
const xMax = width - margin.left - margin.right;
const yMax = height - margin.top - margin.bottom;

// We'll make some helpers to get at the data we want
const x = d => d.letter;
const y = d => +d.frequency * 100;

// And then scale the graph by our data
const xScale = scaleBand({
  rangeRound: [0, xMax],
  domain: data.map(x),
  padding: 0.4,
});
const yScale = scaleLinear({
  rangeRound: [yMax, 0],
  domain: [0, Math.max(...data.map(y))],
});

// Compose together the scale and accessor functions to get point functions
const compose = (scale, accessor) => data => scale(accessor(data));
const xPoint = compose(xScale, x);
const yPoint = compose(yScale, y);

// Finally we'll embed it all in an SVG
function BarGraph(props) {
  return (
    <svg width={width} height={height}>
      {data.map((d, i) => {
        const barHeight = yMax - yPoint(d);
        return (
          <Group key={`bar-${i}`}>
            <Bar
              x={xPoint(d)}
              y={yMax - barHeight}
              height={barHeight}
              width={xScale.bandwidth()}
              fill="#fc2e1c"
            />
          </Group>
        );
      })}
    </svg>
  );
}

// ... somewhere else, render it ...
// <BarGraph />
```

## Motivation

**Goal**

The goal is to create a library of components you can use to make both your own reusable chart
library or your slick custom one-off chart. vx is largely unopinionated and is meant to be built
upon. Keep your bundle sizes down and use only the packages you need.

**How?**

Under the hood, vx is using d3 for the calculations and math. If you're creating your own awesome
chart library on top of vx, it's easy to create a component api that hides d3 entirely. Meaning your
team could create charts as easily as using reusable react components.

**But why?**

Mixing two mental models for updating the DOM is never a good time. Copy and pasting d3 code into
`componentDidMount()` is just that. This collection of components lets you easily build your own
reusable visualization charts or library without having to learn d3. No more selections or
`enter()`/`exit()`/`update()`.

## Status

`Beta` We're still in pre v1. Need to add interactions. No breaking changes planned right now
[read more](https://github.com/hshoff/vx/issues/156#issuecomment-331318108). Check out
[the road to v1](https://github.com/hshoff/vx/projects/1).

If you're a curious coder, feel free to install and play around with the packages. I recommend using
`--save-exact` when you `npm install`.

## Roadmap

Lots coming soon, check out the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md).

## FAQ

1. What does `vx` stand for?

   > vx stands for visualization components.

1. Do you plan on supporting animation/transitions?

   > A common criticism of vx is it doesn't have animation baked in, but this was a concious choice.
   > It's a powerful feature to not bake it in.
   >
   > Imagine your app already bundles `react-motion`, adding a hypothetical `@vx/animation` is
   > bloat. Since vx is react, it already supports all react animation libs.
   >
   > Charting libraries are like style guides. Each org or app will eventually want full control
   > over their own implementation.
   >
   > vx makes this easier for everyone. No need to reinvent the wheel each time.
   >

1. Do I have to use every package to make a chart?

   > nope! pick and choose the packages you need.

1. Can I use this to create my own library of charts for my team?

   > Please do.

1. Does vx work with [preact](https://preactjs.com/)?

   > yup! need to alias `react` + `react-dom` and use `preact-compat`. Here's a quick demo:
   > https://vx-preact.now.sh/.
   > [more info](https://preactjs.com/guide/switching-to-preact#how-to-alias-preact-compat)

1. I like using d3.

   > Me too.

## Development

[Yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) are used to manage dependencies and
build config across packages in the umbrella `vx` monorepo, and
[lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/) is used to manage versioning.

```
vx/
  lerna.json
  package.json
  packages/
    vx-package-1/
      src/
      test/
      build/
      package.json
      ...
    vx-package-2/
      ...
    ...
```

Run the following to setup your local dev environment:

```sh
# Install `yarn`, alternatives at https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash

# Clone or fork `vx`
git clone git@github.com:hshoff/vx.git # or your fork
cd vx

# install dependencies, and have `yarn` symlink within-`vx` dependencies
yarn

# build packages and generate types for local development
yarn build
```

#### Rebuild one package

Upon modification of a single `package` you can run

```sh
# build the package as cjs version
yarn build-one --workspaces=@vx/package

# build the esm version (the @vx/demo next server sources these files)
yarn build-one --workspaces=@vx/package --esm

# generate d.ts(definition files) for a lib
yarn type-one --workspaces=@vx/package --esm
```

from the `vx` monorepo root to re-build the package with your changes.

#### Running demo pages

You can use the local [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org) dev server within `packages/vx-demo` to view
and iterate on your changes in the gallery. From the `packages/vx-demo` folder run `yarn dev` to
start the next server which (if correctly sym-linked) will also watch for changes you make to other
packages (upon re-building them).

#### Config generation

`vx` uses [`@airbnb/nimbus`](https://github.com/airbnb/nimbus) to generate build configuration for
`eslint`, `prettier`, `jest`, `babel`, and `typescript`.
